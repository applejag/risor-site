# Risor Examples

Here are some examples of how to use Risor. _This is a work in progress._

## Install Risor Using Homebrew

```bash copy
brew tap risor-io/risor
brew install risor
risor version
```

## Start the REPL

Running `risor` with no options starts the REPL:

```bash copy
risor
```

## Evaluate a Code Snippet

Use the `-c` option to pass in code as a command line option:

```bash copy
risor -c "time.now()"
```

## Evaluate a Script

Pass the path to a Risor script as an argument:

```bash copy
risor hello.risor
```

In _hello.risor_:

```go copy
print("hello")
```
