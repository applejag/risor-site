# Working with Maps

Maps are a container for key-value pairs. In Risor, map keys must always be
strings, which provides equivalence between maps and JSON objects. Under the
hood, Risor maps are made from `map[string]interface{}` in Go.

## Declaring Maps

It is optional to surround keys in quotes when declaring a map literal:

```go copy
{ name: "Alice", age: 30 }
```

## Iterating Over a Map

```go copy
m := {
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: 3,
}

for k, v := range m {
    print("k:", k, "v:", v)
}
```

```text filename="Output:"
k: a v: 1
k: b v: 2
k: c v: 3
```

## Indexing a Map

```go copy
user := {
    name: "John",
    age:  30,
}

print(user["name"])
```

```text filename="Output:"
John
```

## Delete an Item

```go copy
user := {
    name: "John",
    age:  30,
}

delete(user, "age")

print(keys(user))
```

```text filename="Output:"
[name]
```
