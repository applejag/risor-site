# How It Works

Risor follows standard patterns for implementing a scripting language. This
includes parsing source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), compiling the
AST into bytecode, and then executing the bytecode on a lightweight virtual
machine.

The excellent book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)
was the original inspiration for the project.

## The Internals

Risor includes the following internal components:

- A [lexer](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/tree/main/lexer) which takes
  source code as input and produces a stream of tokens as output.
- A [parser](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/tree/main/parser) which takes
  tokens as an input and produces an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- A [compiler](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/tree/main/compiler) which
  compiles the AST into Risor bytecode instructions.
- A [virtual machine](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/tree/main/vm) which
  executes the program bytecode.
- [Built-in types](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/tree/main/object)
  available to all programs.
- [Built-in functions](https://github.com/risor-io/risor/blob/main/builtins/builtins.go)
  that are accesible by default.
