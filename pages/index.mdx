Risor offers a new way to write scripts, integrate systems, and interact with the cloud.
Enjoy a modern and familiar language with a huge amount of built-in functionality for interacting with databases, HTTP, and more.

## Example

```go copy
array := ["gophers", "are", "burrowing", "rodents"]

sentence := array | strings.join(" ") | strings.to_upper

print(sentence)
```

Output:

```filename="output"
GOPHERS ARE BURROWING RODENTS
```

## Why Choose Risor?

Risor may be a great fit for your project if any of this is valuable to you:

- General purpose: Work with JSON, HTTP, database connections, and more.
- Fast: The fastest pure-Go scripting language (as of June 2023)
- Familiar: Friendly syntax for Go and Python developers.
- Expressive: Easily express lists, maps, sets and transformations on them.
- Pipe expressions: Quickly create processing pipelines.
- Customizable: Add your own types and built-in functions.
- Single binary: The Risor binary includes built-in libraries and packages.

## Editor

Try running Risor from your browser! The code is evaluated in a cloud region _close to you_.
Note that the final value in the script is what is shown below. Any stdout from
the script is not yet shown.
