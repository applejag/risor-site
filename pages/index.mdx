A fast and flexible embedded scripting language for Go projects. Risor compiles scripts to bytecode internally which it then runs on a lightweight Virtual Machine (VM). Risor is written in pure Go.

Risor modules integrate the Go standard library, making it easy to write scripts using functions that you're already familiar with as a Go developer.
